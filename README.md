# 🛡️ Buttercup Games Mail Server Security Analysis

Welcome to the **Buttercup Games Mail Server Security Analysis** project! This project focuses on identifying potential security issues related to failed SSH login attempts for the root account on our mail server using Splunk.

## 🚀 Project Overview

As part of our ongoing efforts to secure Buttercup Games' infrastructure, this project involves querying the Splunk tool to detect and analyze failed SSH login attempts specifically targeting the root account. These logs help us identify possible unauthorized access attempts and improve our security measures.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Splunk**: Our primary tool for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated big data via a web-style interface.
- **Linux/Unix**: The operating system where SSH logins are monitored.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- **Identify Failed SSH Logins**: Query the Splunk tool to extract all failed SSH login attempts for the root account.
- **Analyze Patterns**: Determine if there are any suspicious patterns, such as repeated attempts from the same IP address.
- **Strengthen Security**: Provide recommendations based on the findings to enhance the security of the mail server.
